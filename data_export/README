-	Data exported from .xdf to .txt 
-	Path to export script: /<username>/Box/EMG_project/bricks_data_copy/matlab_scripts/mia/xdf_export_2020-02-17.m
-	Each subject has two files:

	segments - time and sampling parameters for the 3 calibration phases (relax, flex, extend) 	and the game play. Segments will import as a table with variable names.

	Row names:  	calibrate_rest
			calibrate_flex
			calibrate_extend
			game_play
	
	Var names: 	num_samples
			index_range (min-max)
			t_begin
			t_end
			duration (sec)
			effective_srate (observed sampling rate, Hz; expected sampling at 2kHz) 


	time_channels - concatenated time bin and channel recording data 

	Row names:  	time_bins (ms)
			channel_01
			channel_02
	
	Var names: 	Var01....VarN (time bins)
